# python-ESL

This is FreeSWITCH's [Python ESL SWIG wrapper](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/Python+ESL)
pulled directly out of tree on version `1.4.18` with no modifications.

All we've done is replaced the `Makefile` with `setuptools` to make the package
easy to install with pip:

    pip install python-ESL

It should work on both python 2 and 3.
